# Nexus ‚ö°Ô∏è - Real-Time Chat & P2P File Transfer

![Nexus Demo GIF](./.github/assets/nexus-demo.gif)

**Nexus** is a modern, high-performance web application that enables real-time, peer-to-peer (P2P) communication directly in the browser. Using WebRTC, it allows users to create private rooms for secure text chat and lightning-fast direct file transfers, all without data passing through a central server.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy of Nexus up and running on your machine for development and testing.

### Prerequisites

*   **Go:** Make sure you have Go (version 1.18 or newer) installed. [Download Go](https://golang.org/dl/)
*   **A Modern Web Browser:** Chrome, Firefox, Edge, or Safari.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository**

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/nexus.git
    cd nexus
    ```

2.  **Run the Backend Signaling Server**

    The Go server handles user authentication and WebRTC signaling. Navigate to the backend directory and run the server:

    ```sh
    # Assuming your Go code is in a `backend` sub-directory
    cd backend
    go run main.go
    ```

    The server will start, typically on `localhost:8080`.

3.  **Launch the Frontend**

    The frontend is a static HTML file that can be opened directly in your browser. However, for security reasons (CORS), it's best served by a simple local server.

    *   **Using a Live Server Extension (Recommended for Dev):**
        If you use VS Code, the [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension is perfect. Right-click on `index.html` and select "Open with Live Server".

    *   **Using Python's HTTP Server:**
        If you have Python installed, navigate to the frontend directory and run:
        ```sh
        # For Python 3
        python -m http.server
        ```
        Then open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

4.  **Connect Two Peers**

    *   Open two separate browser windows (or tabs).
    *   In the first window, sign up and create a new room. A Room ID will be displayed.
    *   In the second window, sign up (with a different username) and use the Room ID from the first window to join the room.
    *   You're connected! Start chatting and sending files.
